# About
GameLauncher is a simple way to launch games, quickly and easily. It was made using [Nextron](https://github.com/saltyshiomix/nextron), which utilizes Next.js and Electron. Moreover, this project also incorporates the use of [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for a cleaner design.

# Getting Started
To get started, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/FireStreaker2/GameLauncher/releases/latest) page and download the corresponding binary for your operating system. Alternatively, you may also [compile it yourself](https://github.com/FireStreaker2/GameLauncher#compiling).

## Compiling
If you would like to compile this manually, follow the below steps.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FireStreaker2/GameLauncher.git
$ cd GameLauncher
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

After everything has been compiled, the result should be in the ``dist/`` folder.

# Usage
In the input, enter a command that will start a program/task. Examples:
* ``node ~/Downloads/Game/index.js``
* ``~/Documents/start.sh``
* ``~/Games/ULTRAKILL/ULTRAKILL.x86_64``
